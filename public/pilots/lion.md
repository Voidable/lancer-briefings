Biography:
Born to a backwater rim world, Benton had little going for him. having found his fathers stash of old recorded mech battles from his time in the arena, Benton quickly gained a fascination with Mechs. In his early teen years he did everything in his power to become a mechanic, eventually landing a job disassembling ruined mechs at a scrap-yard.
Upon reaching adulthood, he was able to sign on with a mercenary lance as their onboard mechanic. He travelled with them for a handful of years, learning everything he could about mechs and also forming a tight bond with his crew.

On a mission to deter an imposing pirate lance brigade on a Federal planet, the crew that Benton held dear perished suddenly, and with little warning.
illegal or contraband weapons in pirate hands led to the swift death of his allies.
Having lost their lance and mechs, the mercenary lance soon disbanded, selling off their ship and everything on it.
With no contract or crew, Benton has set off to join the Union's Military academy. with proper training, and a mech of his own, Benton hopes he can join another Lance, and stop such tragedy from happening.

Due to having lost the lance he original worked for at the hands of pirates with illegal and contraband weapons, Benton holds a great distaste for illegal weapons. He will frown upon and have issue with allies using any weapon that could be considered illegal or contraband.

Benton is a quiet man, struggle and hardship has brought him humility. Few know how greatly he treasures his allies, nor do they know how frequently he is trying to form new creations or adjustments to better their survival on the field. though, those he has spent a long time with, often in battle or in the mechbay, tend to realize there is more going on in his head than he lets on, and those that have bonded with him know that whenever he's on the field, they will always have a true ally on their side.
